# Adaptive Cards V2 documentation

# Context

Adaptive Cards are platform-agnostic snippets of UI, sent as JSON, that apps and services can share. See [adaptivecards.io](http://adaptivecards.io) for more information on Adaptive Cards. Adaptive cards not only adapt to the look-and-feel of the host, but also provide rich interaction capabilities.

As Adaptive Cards grew in popularity, different hosts started supporting different action models and this led to fragmentation.

Adaptive Cards v2 is an effort to consolidate these actions with a single action model named "Action.Execute"
